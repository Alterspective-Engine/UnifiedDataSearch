# UnifiedDataSearch Bug Fix Summary

## Issues Fixed

### 1. ✅ **Undefined 'search' Method Error**
**Problem:** `Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'search')`
- MockPmsService wasn't properly initialized when widget tried to use it
- Service singleton wasn't available in the global namespace

**Solution:**
- Added defensive initialization checks in both widget and blade
- Service creates itself if not already initialized
- Added fallback to empty results if service unavailable

### 2. ✅ **Service Initialization Issues**
**Problem:** Services not available when blade/widget loads
- Race condition between service loading and blade initialization
- Missing service singletons

**Solution:**
- Added lazy initialization pattern
- Services check and create instances on-demand
- Added proper error handling with console warnings

### 3. ✅ **Entity Type Filtering Not Working**
**Problem:** Selecting "Organisation" filter still showed persons (Igor)
- PMS search always returned persons when "all" was selected
- No proper merging of both entity types for "all" option

**Solution:**
- Fixed `searchPms()` to properly handle all three cases:
  - "person" - searches only persons
  - "organisation" - searches only organisations  
  - "all" - searches BOTH and merges results
- Added `searchPmsType()` helper method for specific type searches
- Frontend filtering via `filteredResults` computed observable remains as backup

## Code Changes Made

### 1. **UnifiedOdsEntityPicker.js**
```javascript
// Added defensive initialization
if (!mockService) {
    console.warn("Mock service not available, trying to initialize");
    if (Alt.UnifiedDataSearch.Services.MockPmsService) {
        mockService = new Alt.UnifiedDataSearch.Services.MockPmsService();
        Alt.UnifiedDataSearch.Services.mockPmsService = mockService;
    }
}

// Check service has search method before calling
if (mockService && typeof mockService.search === 'function') {
    var pmsPromise = mockService.search(type, query, 0);
}
```

### 2. **blade.js - buildServices()**
```javascript
// Ensure all services are initialized
if (!Alt.UnifiedDataSearch.Services.mockPmsService) {
    console.warn("MockPmsService not found, creating new instance");
    if (Alt.UnifiedDataSearch.Services.MockPmsService) {
        Alt.UnifiedDataSearch.Services.mockPmsService = new Alt.UnifiedDataSearch.Services.MockPmsService();
    }
}
```

### 3. **blade.js - searchPms()**
```javascript
// Fixed to properly handle all entity types
if (entityType === "all") {
    // Search BOTH persons and organisations
    var personsPromise = self.searchPmsType("persons", query, page);
    var orgsPromise = self.searchPmsType("organisations", query, page);
    
    // Merge results
    return $.when(personsPromise, orgsPromise).then(function(personsResult, orgsResult) {
        // Combine both result sets
    });
}
```

## Testing Checklist

- [x] Widget loads without errors
- [x] Typing "igor" triggers search without crash
- [x] MockPmsService initializes properly
- [x] Person filter shows only persons
- [x] Organisation filter shows only organisations
- [x] "All" filter shows both types
- [x] Error messages display correctly
- [x] Search results display properly

## Remaining Considerations

### Performance
- Services are created on-demand which may cause slight delay on first search
- Consider pre-initializing services in a global include file

### Error Handling
- Added console warnings for debugging
- Falls back to empty results instead of crashing
- User sees "No results" instead of error

### Future Improvements
1. **Pre-load services** in panel.json scripts section
2. **Add loading spinner** while services initialize
3. **Cache service instances** more aggressively
4. **Add retry logic** for failed service initialization

## Deployment Notes

1. **Clear browser cache** - Old JavaScript may be cached
2. **Check script loading order** in panel.json:
   ```json
   "scripts": [
       "/_ideFiles/Alt/UnifiedDataSearch/Helpers/namespace.js",
       "/_ideFiles/Alt/UnifiedDataSearch/Services/MockPmsService.js",
       "/_ideFiles/Alt/UnifiedDataSearch/Services/ResultMergerService.js",
       "/_ideFiles/Alt/UnifiedDataSearch/Blades/UnifiedOdsPmsSearch/blade.js"
   ]
   ```
3. **Verify all files deployed** to ShareDo environment
4. **Test in multiple browsers** for compatibility

## User Impact

### Before Fix
- Blade would crash when typing in search
- Entity type filters didn't work
- Confusing error messages

### After Fix
- Smooth search experience
- Proper entity type filtering
- Graceful error handling
- Clear console messages for debugging
