It validates (read-only):

<tasks>
1) If needed, refine display/readme notes for the live test script.
2) Keep any existing unit tests that don't mock network disabled or annotate them clearly as optional.
3) Ensure docs mention: `cp .env.sharedo.sample .env.sharedo` then `bash scripts/test-live-unified-search.sh "igor" person`.
